  description: Wrote the volumetric renderer using the differentiable
               Halide programming language and in CUDA, demonstrating
               an improvement in memory consumption of two orders of
               magnitude over the state-of-the-art. Performed several
               experiments which demonstrate the capabilities of the
               renderer on inverse rendering tasks.

  description: Designed a differentiable volumetric renderer of signed
               distance functions. Experimented with hierarchical
               distance function representations. Designed a method of
               maintaining the Lipschitz continuity of a distance
               field during gradient descent.

  description: Gave a research presentation on Google AI's RAISR image
               super-resolution algorithm, and wrote an efficient GPU
               implementation of the algorithm. Wrote an upsampling
               benchmark to evaluate the performance of different
               image upscaling techniques and architectures. Ported
               GLFW and WaveWorks to Android for the Nvidia Tegra platform.

  description: Designed a sound propagation technique which leveraged
               the benefits of numerical methods and geometrical
               acoustics. Implemented an efficient finite-difference
               time domain (FDTD) solver with a perfectly matched layer
               (PML).

  description: Adapted my previous work on point-cloud rendering to
               the Cesium geospatial rendering engine. Improved upon
               the reconstruction quality and performance described in
               the original paper.

  description: Designed, and implemented an image processing pipeline
               for infilling and cleaning Kinect depth maps. Also
               implemented and improved a real-time point cloud surface
               reconstruction technique. Supervised by Professor Fredo
               Durand.

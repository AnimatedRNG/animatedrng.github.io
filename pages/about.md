# **About Me**

Hi, I'm Srinivas Kaza. I received a Master's of Engineering degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in September 2019. I completed my Bachelor's degree a couple months prior in June 2019. I am currently working at a self-driving car startup.

My interests span computer graphics, image processing, systems engineering, and computer vision.

`sdf-play` is a sandbox for modeling implicit functions, originally created as the 6.839 (Advanced Computer Graphics and Fabrication) [final project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mx1yMIBqL0sdGe5ShjZMQSYLiR0RcKldhiShOi7tegY/edit?usp=sharing). Changes to the geometry, texturing, and lighting are reflected in the rendering preview immediately.

I recently taught a [Splash Class](https://github.com/AnimatedRNG/sdf-play) about implicit modeling, using sdf-play as a teaching tool. See the slides below.
